# Mars Rover em React e Adonis

## A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.

This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

A roverâ€™s position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing North.

In order to control a rover , NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are â€˜Lâ€™, â€˜Râ€™ and â€˜Mâ€™. â€˜Lâ€™ and â€˜Râ€™ makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. â€˜Mâ€™ means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

The project was developed with the following tools:
React - lib to build user interfaces with reusable components
Adonis - a nodejs backend framework.

# Features

[x] Create plateau
[x] Create rover

Important: A new rover will always use information of the latest created plateau. Please make sure to create a plateau before adding a new rover.

# Requirements and how to run the application
  Mariadb
  NodeJs


In this repository youâ€™ll find the backend and frontend code. Before starting, run â€˜npm iâ€™ on both project folders. Then, on the backend folder, create the project database using the commands:
```
	mysql -u root -p
	CREATE DATABASE MarsRover;
	exit
```
Run the migrations with:
```
	node ace migration:run
```
To undo the migrations:
```
	node ace migration:rollback
```
Before starting the backend, create a .env file. A sample of the .env can be found in .env.example.

To run the backend project:
```
	npm run dev
```
To run the frontend project:
```
	npm start
```
Important: please, make sure that your database is up and the backend service is running before starting the frontend application.
